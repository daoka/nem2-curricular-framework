NEM is a blockchain platform that can power both private and public networks with its unique built-in features.

When elaborating training material, you should keep in mind that NEM currently comes in two different versions.

* **NIS1**: Running on the main-net since April 2015.

* **Catapult**: NEM next NEM blockchain engine. It has been coded from the ground up to add new features, improvements in speed and scalability.
We advise explaining the concepts available in the latest version. See [Annex. NIS1/Catapult: Comparison Matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _units/20-annex.markdown %}) to check what works different, and the list of added functionality.

When it comes to the implementation and usage, decide whether teaching NIS1 or Catapult, based on the target audience and tools available.
