NEM is a blockchain platform that can power both private and public networks with its unique built-in features.

When elaborating training material, remember that NEM is available in two different versions.

* **NIS1**: Running on the main-net since April 2015.

 * **Catapult**: NEM next NEM blockchain engine. It has been coded from the ground up to add new features, improvements in speed and scalability.
We advise explaining the concepts available in the latest version. See [Annex. NIS1/Catapult: Comparison Matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _units/19-annex.markdown %}) to check what works different, and the list of added functionality.

When it comes to the implementation and usage, decide whether teaching in NIS1, or go directly to Catapult, based on the target audience and tools available.
