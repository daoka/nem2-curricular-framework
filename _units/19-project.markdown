## Learning objectives

| Learning Objective | Learning Level | Keywords |
| Apply the NEM Development Cycle. |  3 - Apply | |
| Design and develop a project using NEM.  |   6 - Create | |
| Judge when to use built-in features or create your new plugin. | 5 - Evaluate | |

## Proposed Outline

The outline for this unit is flexible. Here are some examples of projects students can build.

### Option A: Horizontal project

One common option is to include it as a transversal activity during the course. In [3.  NEM Development Cycle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _units/07-development-cycle.markdown %}), the student can start to design their project, and then build the project throughout the course.

### Option B: Project based on a use case

Propose a specific use case to solve. Students can define and develop the solution.

Examples: 

* Identity.
* Ticketing. [Example](https://blockchain.craftain.com/courses/getting-started-with-nem-catapult/)
* Digital notarization. [Example](https://nemtech.github.io/nem2-workshop-document-notarization/)
* Supply-Chain. [Example](https://nemtech.github.io/nem2-workshop-nem-applied-to-supply-chain/)

### Option C: Specific project around a plugin / feature

Propose to create a project based on a particular NEM feature or the creation of a new plugin to enhance NEM capabilities.

Examples: 

* Atomic trading between NEM private and public chain.
* Create a Catapult plugin/library.
