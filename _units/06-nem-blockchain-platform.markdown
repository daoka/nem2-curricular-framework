## Proposed outline

1. Introduction
    * Blockchain Platform.
    * Speed:
        - Ease of development and integration (cutting costs/time).
        - SDK and API based (develop in any language).
        - Smart Assets System (rapid built-in features overview).
    * Secure:
        - Built from scratch and running since 2015.
        - Keep business logic off-chain, as logic can be changed in case of error.
        - Spam protection.
    * Scalable
        - Public and private approach: seamless integration using the same tools and core.
        - Cost-effective infrastructure.
        - Keep business logic off-chain, as logic can be adapted to new requirements.
2. Protocol
    * Describe NEM's 4-layered architecture:
        - Core
        - API & MongoDB
        - SDKs
        - NEM Apps
    * Detail NEM's consensus algorithm:
        - POI (NIS1)
    * Introduce XEM cryptocurrency to pay transaction and services fees.

3. NEM business cases
    * Show real uses of NEM applied to different industries.

### Activities

**SysAdmin**                                                                                                                                                                                           
* Running your own NEM public node. [NIS1](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-supernode-command-line-tutorial-for-debian-8-4/2211), Catapult TBD
