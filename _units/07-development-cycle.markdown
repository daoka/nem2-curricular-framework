## Proposed outline

1. Introduction
    * Introduce section.
2. Where (not) apply blockchain?
    * Explain when to apply blockchain, and when not.
    * Advise when to use public, private or permissioned approach.
3. Technology choice
    * Advise on technology choice:
        - Technologies must fit the use case.
        - Mitigate risk of immutability by choosing flexible technologies.
4. Architecting on NEM
    * Describe multiple ways to integrate NEM blockchain.
        - Application clients are directly connected with NEM nodes. The logic will happen client side.  
        - Application clients that directly communicate with NEM nodes and other clients communicate via application servers to the NEM nodes.
        - Application clients connect to an application server that is connected to the NEM nodes. 
5. Anatomy of a NEM application
    * Define the minimum viable product:
        - Define the exact value proposition to use blockchain. 
        - Narrow the scope.
    * Abstract the authorization model: Who is allowed to do what.
        - Identify every actor and entity.
        - Describe every process: what is the transaction model and the data model.
        - Define user interaction: how does an actor interact with the application.
    * Define the data modelling: Find out where NEM blockchain (and other technologies) plays its role in a use-case.
