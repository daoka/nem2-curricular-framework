## Proposed outline

1. Introduction
    * Introduce the course.
2. What is blockchain?
    * Explain what blockchain technology is.
    * Explain which problems try to solve.
        - Trust
    * Remark blockchain properties:
        -	Immutability.
        - Distributed.
    * Describe blockchain challenges when developing applications:
        -	Immutability.
        -	Security.
        - Inefficient.
        - Transparency.
3. Use Cases
    * Present a set of use cases where blockchain can fit.
4. How does blockchain work?
    * Detail how blockchain technology works, explaining how blocks, transactions and hash are related.
    * Explain different consensus algorithms.
        - Proof of Work.
        - Proof of Stake.
        - Proof of Importance.
5. Types of Network
    * Describe the different types of network.
      - Public.
      - Permissioned.
      - Private.
    * Enumerate characteristics of permissioned/private blockchains. 
      - Immutable or not.
      - Transparent or not.
      - More transactions per second.

## Activities

* Explain how blockchain works using a visual tool ([I](https://blockchaindemo.io/), [II](https://guggero.github.io/blockchain-demo/))
* Compare different hashing algorithms using an online calculator ([I](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha3_512.html), [II](https://www.pelock.com/products/hash-calculator))
