## Proposed outline

1. Introduction
    * Explain what is blockchain.
    * Explain which problems solve:
        - Trust
    * Remark blockchain properties:
        - Immutability
        - Distributed
    * Describe blockchain challenges when developing applications:
        - Immutability
        - Security
        - Inefficient
        - Transparency
2. Use Cases
    * Present a set of use cases where blockchain can fit.
3. How does blockchain work?
    * Detail how blockchain technology works, explaining how blocks, transactions and hash are related.
    * Explain different consensus algorithms:
        - Proof of Work
        - Proof of Stake
        - Proof of Importance
4. Types of Network
    * Describe the different types of network.
      - Public
      - Permissioned
      - Private
    * Enumerate characteristics of permissioned/private blockchains:
      - Immutability?
      - Transparency?
      - More transactions per second

## Activities

* Explain how blockchain works using a visual tool ([I](https://blockchaindemo.io/), [II](https://guggero.github.io/blockchain-demo/))
* Compare different hashing algorithms using an online calculator ([I](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha3_512.html), [II](https://www.pelock.com/products/hash-calculator))
