# nem2-curricular-framework

    ℹ️ The NEM Curricular Framework is under construction. The structure may be substantially modified until the version 1.0.0.
   
The **NEM Curricular Framework** provides the complete set of concepts, activities, resources and common practices to quick deliver NEM related quality training.

The purpose of this project is to **guide interested education providers to create NEM educational material**. 

**Use this framework as a guide**. The intention is not to kill creativity while developing your program; we love to see how educational providers do their courses in their way. Feel free to modify the order of the proposed course contents, create your activities and apply new learning methods.
